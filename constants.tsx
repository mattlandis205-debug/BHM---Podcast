export const PODCAST_CONTEXT = `
This activity is based on a podcast about Black History Month and the American Revolution. 
Key themes:
1. The founding contradiction: Freedom for white colonists vs. slavery for Black people.
2. The British Promise: Proclamations (1775, 1779) offering freedom to slaves of PATRIOT masters only.
3. The American Reality: Black soldiers like Peter Salem fought for liberty, but the new nation failed to provide it broadly.
4. Elizabeth Freeman: Used the law to win her freedom in Massachusetts.
5. The Book of Negroes: 4,000 Black Loyalists were taken to Canada by the British.
